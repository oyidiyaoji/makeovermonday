# makeovermonday
This repository contains a project I built from Make Over Monday a website focused on fostering data visualization. Each week they submit a new dataset about a random topic and I collected this dataset that look more appealing to analyze. It is a report about 74 different breakfast cereals with their composition and final rating. This visualization was donde with Google Data Studio.
