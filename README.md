# makeovermonday
This repository contains the projects I build from Make Over Monday a website focused on EDA and visualization. Each week they submit a new dataset about a random topic and I collect those datasets that look more appealing to analyze. I will be listing the different projects I decide to add to Github: 

- 74 different breakfast cereals with their composition and final rating.
